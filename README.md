# lelabocollectif.fr

Prototype website for the association "le labo collectif" with home, documentation, contact form and forum space.

The first idea was a static website to display the association infos et news. 
Then i added a documentation page to display the association booklets.

Next we discussed about a contact form to get message from visitors, so i coded a basic form using phpmailer library to send the message via gmail smtp server with the association gmail account.
This will need to be reconfigured as google will soon update its security requirement (2-step verification).

The main idea of this website was to develop a forum space with a connexion space where the association contributors could posts review message about their workshop.
For now, you can create an account, create posts, update and delete them and delete your account.

This will need further work as their is no real mail verification on account creation.
More features will come, like comments section and the possibility to add pictures and files to each posts.
I also have to rework the design and responsive design.

The developpment of this project allowed me to learn coding, especially CSS, PHP and MySQL.
No frameworks here, i wanted to learn pure basic languages first.

I hope you'll like it.
